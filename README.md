# Fake News Prediction Model

## Project Description

This project develops a foundational machine learning model for identifying fake news. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system preprocesses news article text and uses a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a given piece of news is "real" or "fake". The project features a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio, allowing real-time prediction by simply pasting news content. This demonstrates a complete pipeline from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and interactive deployment.

**Note:** The dataset used in this demonstration is small and for illustrative purposes only. A robust fake news detection system would require a much larger and more diverse dataset for training.

## Features

  * **Text Preprocessing:** Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to clean and prepare text data.
  * **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transforms textual data into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), capturing word importance.
  * **Logistic Regression Classifier:** A simple yet effective machine learning model trained to classify news articles.
  * **Model Evaluation:** Reports accuracy and a classification report (precision, recall, f1-score) on a test set.
  * **Interactive Web UI (Gradio):** Provides a clean and easy-to-use interface for users to input news text and receive instant predictions.
  * **Confidence Scores:** Displays the model's confidence for both "Real News" and "Fake News" predictions.
  * **Google Colab Ready:** Optimized for execution within Google Colab environments.

## Technologies Used

  * **Python**
  * **scikit-learn:** For machine learning models (Logistic Regression), TF-IDF vectorization, and data splitting.
  * **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  * **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming).
  * **Gradio:** For rapid development of the interactive web user interface.
  * **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** (Included in code, though visualization outputs aren't directly in this script for this small dataset, they are standard tools for analysis).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally, ideally in a Google Colab environment.

### Prerequisites

  * A Google account (for Google Colab access).
  * Internet connection (to download libraries and NLTK data).

### Installation (in Google Colab)

Open a new Google Colab notebook and paste the entire provided code into a cell.

The script includes the necessary installation commands:

```python
!pip install scikit-learn pandas nltk gradio seaborn matplotlib
```

And NLTK data downloads:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```

### Running the Project

1.  **Mount Google Drive (Optional):** The first two lines of the script `from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')` are typically used if you need to access files from your Google Drive (e.g., a larger dataset). For this self-contained example with an inline dataset, it's not strictly necessary for the core functionality but doesn't hurt. You can execute it if you intend to load external data later.

2.  **Execute the Code:** Run all cells in your Google Colab notebook.

3.  **Gradio UI Launch:**

      * After the model training and evaluation steps complete, the Gradio interface will automatically launch.
      * A local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) and a public shareable link (e.g., `https://xxxx.gradio.live/`, valid for 72 hours) will be printed in the Colab output.
      * Open either of these URLs in your web browser.

4.  **Interact with the UI:**

      * Paste your desired news text into the "News Article Text" input box.
      * The model will predict whether it's "Real News" or "Fake News" and show confidence percentages below.

## Project Structure (Conceptual)

Since the entire code is in a single Colab notebook, the "structure" refers more to the logical flow:

```

## How it Works

1.  **Data Loading:** A small, sample dataset of news headlines and their labels (real/fake) is defined directly within the script.
2.  **Text Preprocessing:** Each news text undergoes a cleaning process:
      * Converted to lowercase.
      * Punctuation and special characters are removed.
      * Text is tokenized into individual words.
      * Common English stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "a") are removed.
      * Words are reduced to their root form (stemming) using Porter Stemmer.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This method assigns weights to words based on how frequently they appear in a document relative to the entire dataset.
4.  **Model Training:** The TF-IDF features are used to train a Logistic Regression model, which learns patterns to differentiate between real and fake news.
5.  **Prediction:** When a new piece of news is entered into the Gradio UI:
      * It undergoes the same preprocessing and TF-IDF transformation.
      * The trained Logistic Regression model then predicts its label (real or fake) and provides confidence scores.
6.  **Gradio UI:** Provides an intuitive web interface for users to interact with the trained model without needing to write any code.

## Limitations

  * **Small Dataset:** The in-code dataset is very limited and intended for demonstration purposes only. A real-world fake news predictor would require hundreds of thousands or millions of labeled examples.
  * **Simple Model:** Logistic Regression, while effective, might not capture complex linguistic nuances as well as more advanced NLP models (e.g., Transformers).
  * **Simple Preprocessing:** The preprocessing steps are basic and could be enhanced (e.g., lemmatization, handling negation, using pre-trained word embeddings).
  * **No External API Integration:** The project relies on an internal dataset; it doesn't fetch live news from an external API.

## Contributing

This project is a great starting point for a fake news prediction system. Feel free to fork the repository and experiment with:

  * Using a larger, external fake news dataset.
  * Trying different NLP preprocessing techniques.
  * Experimenting with other machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or even simple neural networks).
  * Integrating a live news API for real-time article fetching.
  * Improving the Gradio UI with more features or better visualizations.
